Is a project i decided to challenge myself with. While you can simply make this using just the DOM and writing simple scripts to make things work right away. I want to challenge myself with this project by writing functions. This way i can improve on areas such as data structure and writing simple algorithm. In this project i hope to elaborate on some areas so you can hopefully understand how to use everything like i did. I hope to also shout out some stackoverflow peeps for showing me some examples on how i should have writing my code with my own code. I many ways i ended up going a different route and coding myself but they will get their fair share of cudos for opening my mind to dive deep into the problem and how i wanted to solve it.
